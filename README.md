The functions f () and g (), which are defined by the following mathematicians
formulas to be implemented as functions in C language:
 f (x) = {
x + 2, x> 0
−3 x + 7, x≤0} g (x, y) = {
x − y, x> 0 and y> 0
7 x − 5, otherwise}
The values ​​of the parameters x, y in the above functions are integers (int). The type of functions will
determined by you. Implement a program that asks the user for the parameters x and y, and
then displays (a) the result of the function f (x), (b) the result of the function g (x, y) and
result of the function f (g (x)), as shown in the following execution examples. The appearance
of the results will be done through the main program (main function), ie the command
display of results (printf) will be in main ()).
